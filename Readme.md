# The Application

This is a minimalistic blog application which should work using the Django
Rest Framework backend and Vue.JS as the frontend 
framework.<br /> 
I would probably create a new repo for the 
same with a flutter frontend.

Functionalities: 
- [ ] Signup and login
- [ ] Token Auth  for authentication and authorization / JWT
- [ ] Create blog posts
- [ ] Get blog posts for a user
- [ ] Like 
- [ ] Comment
