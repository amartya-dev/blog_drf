# The Application

This is a minimalistic blog application which should work using the Django
Rest Framework backend and Vue.JS as the frontend 
framework.<br /> 
I would probably create a new repo for the 
same with a flutter frontend.

Functionalities: 
- [x] Signup and login
- [x] Token Auth  for authentication and authorization / JWT
- [x] Create blog posts
- [x] Get blog posts for a user
- [x] Like 
- [x] Comment

## Steps to run:
- Clone the repository 
- Run the command: `pip install requirements.txt`
- Run `python manage.py migrate`
